                <p>Robert Wiest grew up in Greeley, Colorado and went to Greeley West High School. After high school, he went to Colorado State University and got a degree in Political Science.
                    But, he always wanted to be a lawyer. So, he went to Gonzaga University School of Law in Spokane, Washington to study law.</p>

                    He's been a lawyer since October 1996. For the past 14 years, he's mostly worked on family law - like divorce, child support, and custody.</p>
                <p>He doesn't just work on family law, though. He also works on child protection cases, probate matters, and even some criminal law cases.
                    Robert doesn't only work in Greeley. He helps people in Adams County, Morgan County, and Larimer County too.</p>
                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Why Choose Robert Wiest</h2>
